# Specification Quality Checklist: Live Database and Learner Roster

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-06
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details beyond constitution-mandated data source requirements
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders where possible
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic where constitution does not require database contract references
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No unnecessary implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Database/table names are included because the constitution mandates live-data source-of-record traceability for data features.
- No formal clarification questions were required; defaults are documented in Assumptions.
